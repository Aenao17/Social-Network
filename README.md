# Social-Network

This project was developed over the course of Semester 3 at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science.

It's an application developed in Java, leveraging JavaFX for the graphical interface and Postgres for the database. I employed Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as Layered Architecture, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Observer.

In addition to the provided code, I've included a demo of the application below. I've set the ID 1 to belong to the admin. The demo begins with the login window presentation, followed by the admin window showcasing functionalities like user deletion and display. It proceeds with user account creation, login, friend request sending, acceptance by the recipient, and a conversation between the two (all visible in both windows thanks to Observer).
